## My approach to solving this issue is to:

1. Prioritize the tasks. Since Task 2 is for a priority customer and has a go-live date in two days, I will focus on completing that task first. I will ask for an extension of three days for Task 1.
2. Communicate with the account managers. I will inform Manoj and Ravi of my approach and ask for their help in communicating with the customers.
3. Communicate with the customers. I will send an email to the customer for Task 1 informing them of the delay. I will apologize for the inconvenience and explain the reason for the delay.

### Internal Message to Manoj (Account Manager for Task 1):

Subject: Request for Task 1 Extension

Dear Manoj,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you of an urgent matter that has arisen. Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, I won't be able to meet the original due date for Task 1, which is scheduled for tomorrow.

As Task 1 pertains to a low-priority customer who hasn't provided a specific go-live date, I believe it would be in the best interest of both parties to request a brief extension for this task. This extension will ensure we can deliver the best quality work once I'm back on track.

I will promptly send an email to the customer explaining the situation and requesting their understanding in granting us a short extension. I will keep you updated on their response and the new proposed timeline for Task 1.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this challenging time.

Best regards,
