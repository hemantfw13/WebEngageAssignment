## My approach to solving this issue is to:

1. Prioritize the tasks. Since Task 2 is for a priority customer and has a go-live date in two days, I will focus on completing that task first. I will ask for an extension of three days for Task 1.
2. Communicate with the account managers. I will inform Manoj and Ravi of my approach and ask for their help in communicating with the customers.
3. Communicate with the customers. I will send an email to the customer for Task 1 informing them of the delay. I will apologize for the inconvenience and explain the reason for the delay.
